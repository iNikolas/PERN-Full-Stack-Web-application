# What is PERN application?

##### PERN stands for:

- PostgreSQL;
- Express;
- React;
- NodeJS.

The prior aim of this application is to show off my programming skills as a Fullstack Developer.

This application is a regular Todo app. But it shows a great usage and conjunction of Databases and React Framework, which effectively stands it out from the same kin.
