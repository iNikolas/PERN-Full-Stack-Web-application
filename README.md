# What is PERN application?

##### PERN stands for:

* PostgreSQL;
* Express;
* React;
* NodeJS.

The prior aim of this application is to show off my programming skills as a Fullstack Developer. 

This application is a regular Todo app. But it shows a great usage and conjunction of Databases and React Framework, which effectively stands it out from the same kin.

### Update 01.03.2022

**{json.api}** principles implemented in the project. Added Not Found and any accidental error handling according to the json.api specification.
